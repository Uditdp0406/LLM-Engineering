# 🧠 LLM Engineering – Hands-On Learning Repository

A practical, end-to-end **LLM Engineering repository** inspired by modern industry practices and learning paths (similar in spirit to Ed Donner–style repos). This project focuses on **building, understanding, and deploying real-world LLM systems**, not just theory.

The repository progresses from fundamentals to production-oriented patterns such as **RAG pipelines, vector databases, agent workflows, and evaluation**, with clean, reproducible implementations.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Learn how Large Language Models work **in practice**
* Build reusable **LLM system components**
* Understand trade-offs in prompt design, retrieval, and orchestration
* Gain production-ready intuition for enterprise AI systems

## ✨ What This Repo Covers

### 🔹 Prompt Engineering

* Zero-shot, few-shot, and structured prompting
* Prompt templates and prompt versioning
* Reducing hallucinations and improving reliability

### 🔹 Embeddings & Vector Databases

* Text chunking strategies
* Embedding generation
* Semantic search and similarity retrieval
* Vector store design patterns

### 🔹 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* Basic RAG pipelines
* Advanced RAG (chunk ranking, filtering)
* Query rewriting and context compression
* Failure modes and mitigation strategies

### 🔹 Agents & Tool Use

* LLM agents with reasoning loops
* Tool calling and function execution
* Multi-step task orchestration
* Guardrails and safety checks

### 🔹 Evaluation & Reliability

* Prompt and response evaluation
* RAG quality assessment
* Latency vs accuracy trade-offs
* Production considerations

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Concept-Focused)

* Python
* OpenAI / Open-source LLMs (pluggable)
* Vector databases (FAISS / Chroma-style)
* LangChain / LLM frameworks (conceptual & practical)

> The repo is framework-aware but **concept-driven**, so ideas remain transferable across tools.
